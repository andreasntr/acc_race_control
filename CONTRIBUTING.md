To allow an easier debug process, please include the following info:

- Make sure your exe file was in the same folder as the config.json file;
- Make sure a session was running before you started the app;
- Describe the steps that preceeded the error;
- Share your *config.json* and *broadcasting.json* files (without passwords, but make sure the **PASSWORD** field in *config.json* matches the **connectionPassword** field in *broadcasting.json*).
